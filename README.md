# 🎯 MOTUS++

> A letter-guessing game built in C++ and QML, inspired by the classic French TV show *Motus* and the online version at [motus.absolu-puzzle.com](https://motus.absolu-puzzle.com/) (Which i'm used to plat)

This project was developed as part of a C++ course at École Centrale de Lyon. As a dedicated *Motus* fan, I aimed to recreate the gameplay experience with a functional backend and an funny graphical interface.
